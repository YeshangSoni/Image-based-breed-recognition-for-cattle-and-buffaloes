# Image-based-breed-recognition-for-cattle-and-buffaloes
This project uses RCNN for image-based breed recognition of cattle and buffaloes. The model detects the animal in an image, extracts features, and classifies its breed automatically. It helps improve accuracy in livestock identification and supports farm and dairy management.
